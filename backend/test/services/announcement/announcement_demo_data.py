**UTA Applications are open for Fall '24 and due May 10th. We are moving away from an AirTable form submission to a custom web application form thanks to the work of Aziz Al-Shayef and Ben Goulet.**

### Applying is easy:

1. Login to the [CSXL](http://csxl.unc.edu/) via your ONYEN
2. After logging in, navigate to [Academics](https://csxl.unc.edu/academics)
3. Look for the Become a TA! pane and complete your application

As we transition to this new system, we ask all current UTAs applying to UTA again in the Fall to go ahead and submit this application. Please cite your current/former UTA experience in the question of "What experience do you have providing service directly to other people?" After this cycle, we will have a different form for returners; this is our bootstrapping semester.

One big, new feature of this application system is you can return to your application and edit it after you have submitted it.

Thanks!
